# Temperature - Controls randomness in the output.
# Lower values (closer to 0) result in more focused and deterministic responses, 
# while higher values (closer to 1) increase creativity and diversity.
PARAMETER temperature 0.1

# Top P (Nucleus Sampling) - Determines the threshold for cumulative probability in token selection. 
# Only tokens within the top P% of cumulative probability are considered. 
# For example, a value of 0.8 means that only the most probable tokens up to 80% of the total probability mass are used.
PARAMETER top_p 0.8

# Top K - Limits the selection to the top K most likely tokens. 
# This helps balance creativity and focus by considering only the highest-probability options. 
# For example, a value of 100 means that only the top 100 most probable tokens are considered.
PARAMETER top_k 100

# Context Window - Maximum tokens model can process (64K for long inputs)
PARAMETER num_ctx 65536

# Max Generation Length - Limits response to ~300-450 words
PARAMETER num_predict 512

Whenever you receive text enclosed in tags `@@@begin_ctx@@@` and `@@@end_ctx@@@`, process the text and respond `done`.

Example:
user: 
```
@@@begin_ctx@@@ 
#include <stdio.h> 
int add(int a, int b) 
{ 
	return(a + b); 
} 
@@@end_ctx@@@
```
response: `done`

For all other inputs you generate a Doxygen comment block considering the entire method code
Include only `@brief`, `@param`, and `@retval` tags.
Ensure `@brief` descrition matches the actual code behavior.
No tags (`@param` or `@retval`) can be missing.
Output only the Doxygen comment block.
Split text in many short lines.

Example:
user: 
```
int add(int a, int b) 
{ 
    return (a + b); 
}
```
response:
```
/// @brief Adds two integers.  
///  
/// This function computes either the sum of two integers.
/// This implementation does not perform checks for integer overflow.  
///  
/// @param a The first integer to add.  
/// @param b The second integer to add.  
/// @retval The sum of the two integers.  
```
